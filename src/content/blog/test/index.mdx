# Why I Purchased a Framework 13 AMD

## Context:
The most striking difference about me, one year into college, was my newfound inability to spend money. This is not surprising as I've never had a proper income all my life and instead, have been happily living off of the hard earned money my parents make. And well, when you're living hundreds of miles away from your parents, that parasitic relationship is suddenly cut off. There's something oddly scary about watching your bank account balance steadily go down over the course of several months. Whether it was gas, food, or fun activities, a dreading feeling overcame me with each purchase. Like rationing food in a long winter storm until spring finally arrives, I questioned every the validity of every purchase and whether it was truly "necessary".

It is at this point where I would also like to note that I have been cycling through three laptops over the last 6 years.  This is an important fact because that would mean that I have over *three times* the amount of laptops the average college student brings to school. So the natural question then is: *why would you possibly need another one???*.  Well, lets take a look at the laptops I currently have in posession:
- My sister's 10 year old dell laptop that can't run Windows at a reasonable speed anymore. I've installed Arch as a lightweight OS in hopes of breathing life into it, but often still find myself pushing the machine to its limits. 
- My first personal laptop ever: A budget entry-level dell gaming laptop with a 1060 Max Q in it. And unfortunately, even if we ignore the broken touchpad, the machine is still a big chunky 1-inch thick bezel spaceship sounding heater with a battery life that's so amazingly bad that I lug around its 2 pound power brick charger everywhere. 
- The love of my life, a 2022 Zephyrus G14. It's a sleek beautiful laptop that had pretty much everything I could ask for. A fast processor, good storage and decent battery life. It was portable and it could meet all my needs. That is... until it completely bricked itself. No worries, I had a warranty and sent it back to the manufacturer for a month... only to discover another problem. Asus has sent me back my laptop with 4 completely unresponsive keys... which later turned into 7 keys that were consistently a problem in my everyday workflow. And unfortunately, due to its lack of reparability, the cost of repairing that keyboard was steep and I was no longer under warranty. Why not connect a portable small external keyboard? Well, I did for awhile and hated it! Constantly connecting and reconnecting my keyboard over 10 times a day in college while constantly finding that I was consistently giving up valuable table real estate for a keyboard. Getting this laptop repaired is like hell. Four of my friends had all gotten themselves a Zephyrus G14, ranging from the 2021-2022 models. All but one Zephyrus managed to survive into 2024 without RMA hell and broken parts.
