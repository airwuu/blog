## My Opinions Are Not Valuable
If you want opinions and advice from some ill informed amateur, you're in the right spot! If you want some actual advice, uhhh maybe you can find something of value here.

The reason why this blog exists is because my thoughts are so malformed and scattered. This is a space for me to formulate my thoughts so that I can pleasantly package them and share them when the time comes. In fact, you may find that this blog is overly verbose and confusing! My bad, but maybe in time and with enough practice, my newer posts will be much more succinct and concise. 


Anyways, it's cool that you're here! Welcome!
