## So I bought a Framework 13 One Year Ago...
Over this past year, I've been writing down my thoughts about the Framework 13 (amd 7640u, 32gb, 1tb) and how it stacks up against my past laptops.

For some context, I've owned a 2022 Zephyrus G14, some 16" Dell Gaming Laptop, and some other old laptops I played around with before this purchase. So, here were my thoughts over the past year!

## The Initial Purchase
The Zephyrus G14 was pretty much my ideal laptop. A nice beautiful 14 inch form factor that's not too gamery, but somehow still packing a mobile GPU for all my gaming and CUDA needs. At the time, I recall it being the best "budget" option at the time. 

The only reason why I switched was because I had to RMA it... and then again.. and then I was finally out of the warranty period when I needed it fixed AGAIN. And unfortunately, a quick search online shows that I'm not the only one with persistent quality control issues.

So, when I was considering a new laptop that was actually functional for school use, I HEAVILY considered repairability and upgradability... which led me to either a used Thinkpad or the Framework laptops.

## Initial Impressions
The unboxing felt very green, there was nearly no plastic or styrofoam to be seen anywhere. I went with the DIY laptop kit and the assembly took maybe 5 minutes to install the ram, keyboard, and storage. Easy Peasy.

As for the laptop itself, the keyboard is fine (I found it to be a bit more mushy than I like, but it probably helps with the contact fatigue of typing all day on it), the 16:10 screen ratio is amazing for that extra vertical space (great when you use vertical tabs), and finally the chassis was definitely not as premium as a Macbook, but still a firm enough metal frame.  

I immediately spun up Fedora onto the laptop and set up my environment, and it was pretty much amazing to see it work out of the box. The fingerprint sensor, power profiles, and even the GUI for keyboard and screen brightness worked without me lifting a finger. How refreshing!

At this point in time, I would've given Framework a solid 8/10 for the thought and effort put into the user experience of a new customer. 

## 6 Months Later...
Like most other unemployed Linux users, I decided to spend my unlimited amount of free time on distro hopping. In my infinite wisdom, I decided to try my hand at creating my own NixOS flake from the ground up alongside a blank Hyprland config. Once again, Framework triumphs as there were plenty of other Framework enthusiasts who had public dots and configs that I could learn (and even steal) from. 

When I eventually switched back to Arch, I found this to remain true as well. 

At some point during these 6 months, I also decided to install Windows onto a refurb Framework expansion slot that I bought. These are essentially USB drives, so I installed Windows-To-Go onto it so that I could take locked down university exams on it. It didn't work, so I ended up swapping Windows onto my main drive and Linux onto my expansion slot. Worked like a charm (and having completely separate drives is so much more pleasant than dual booting with partitions).

## The "Aura" of Owning Such a Cool Laptop
No one cares if you own a Framework 13 or not. In fact, most people have never heard of it and will not even give it a second glance. I was tabling for a computer science related club one time and this guy comes up to me and said, "Hey nice Macbook". 

However, when you get bored in class and you start peeling back the magnetic bezels, you will get questions (e.g. IS YOUR LAPTOP BROKEN?). Or, you might find yourself fortunate enough to be in the same room as someone who is desperately looking for some sort of dongle, and you can just remove one of the ports from your fancy modular laptop and hand it over to them. Congrats! You're about as cool as the other guy in the exact same room who has one of those 9-in-1 usb dongles! 

## One Year Later
I still use this laptop and I still love it. Unfortunately, as I am a commuter and I squish this laptop into my bag nearly everyday, it now has some minor scratches on the screen. Normally, this would kind of be a big deal, but honestly I don't care because I want to upgrade my screen into the nice 2k one that doesn't require fractional scaling. Imagine that. Upgrading individual components on your laptop. 

This laptop is still very much just a laptop. You aren't buying some revolutionary product that will shake up the market. However, with my specs (amd 7640s/32gb/1tb) you should be expecting a pretty fast laptop (it can even handle Minecraft with moderate shaders) with around 6-8 hours of battery with my usual coding and web browsing. My 1 year rating remains an 8/10, and I would imagine that it would only go up when I do upgrade any parts or 3D print some nice customization parts for it. This laptop is great and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to have an "endgame" laptop.
