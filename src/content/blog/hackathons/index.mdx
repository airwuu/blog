## What are Hackathons?
Hackathons are typically 24-48 hour competitions where contestants create a project based on the hackathon "tracks". These are essentially categories you can win in (e.g. AI track winners would have the best use of AI), and are often sponsored by companies who want to create some interest in their field.

So, in an effort to network and upskill, I attended 4 hackathons and 1 gamejam during my sophmore year and did well in all of them. Here's some of my thoughts.

## Is it worth it to participate in a hackathon?
The short answer: No, especially if you are using it to beef up your resume. 

Another popular answer to this question is that it is "fun" to meet a lot of your peers and collectively work yourselves into exhaustion while maintaining as little sleep as possible. They claim that this is a great way to network and upskill.

Once again, no, this is not my definition of fun and productive. While many hackathons host workshops, have booths for companies to drop free merch and market themselves, and often host fun socials, my personal experience in 2024-2025 was that they were underwhelming at best. 

Many of these companies at hackathons are currently AI startups that want you to use their tech (and therefore become their customers). Most of the tech that are taught at hackathons are high level abstractions that ignore the fundamentals that are crucial in upskilling. And also, the socials are pretty much just Linkedin connections farming and personally didn't foster any deeper level conversations.

So why did I end up competing at 4 hackathons?

**The real $$$ for me was in the prizes.** Here's the bounty I personally won after splitting with my teams:
- 2 Ipads
- Assorted Google Merch
- $200 in crypto 
- headphones
- bone conduction earbuds
- various free subscriptions

## Some tips for winning prizes in Hackathons
I got those prizes that I mentioned before because I won at least 1 prize in every hackathon so far. Three of these I would consider quite small with only a few hundred contestants, whereas the biggest one I participated in had around 3000 participants at the venue. It would make sense to correlate the size of the hackathon to the difficulty it takes to win it.

### 1. Ideation
This is the most important part. I would even say that this will get you 70% of the way there. Does your idea/project solve a real problem? If you don't know, search it up and figure out exactly what you will solve *succinctly*. I often make my teams create a Google Doc where we throw down ideas for several hours before having each member grade each idea with a rubric. The highest scoring idea wins. 

But what if you don't like the idea that scores the best? Honestly, if you have teammates that see the vision, really do try your best to understand exactly what they see and hype yourself up. You need to all be aligned with the same goal.

### 2. Your stack / Hardware?
Everyone can make a React Firebase fullstack app. MongoDB, ChatGPT wrapper, etc. All of this is pretty trivial to implement and it will be cringe if you try to present any of these technologies in depth during judging.

Don't get me wrong, USE these technologies because they are easy to deploy, but don't show them off to be what they're not (technically challenging or impressive). If your app needs a database, then go implement Firebase into your app in 30 minutes and then focus on something else that is actually interesting! 

Something that I always try to get my teams to do is to make something that judges can interact with. A live demo where they can use your project to solve a problem is the best thing I think you can do. Simply using hardware (arduino, raspberry pis) will also set you apart from the plethora of fullstack apps. I still think about how one of my competitors at CalHacks 11.0 were using hardware to capture brain waves as their user input in their project.

### 3. Polish and Presentation
Make your project look good! Every project I've worked on has had one member who dedicated several hours on the logo, slides, maybe demo videos, and designing our "elevator pitch" to most efficiently and succinctly convey the context of our project to the judges.

For this example, for my last project we used computer vision to scan and add items into a dashboard where it shows the names of items, the calories, expiration dates, and even live generated recipes based off of that information to reduce food waste.

On top of creating that whole dashboard, one of our members created this 3D model that would reflect whether the door is open or not and what common items are inside of it. This doesn't solve any problems, but it looks cool and contributes to that WOW factor. Polish.

### 4. Be ready to wear many hats
My role during each hackathon changed wildly. I've done frontend, backend, hardware, and even drawn. So make sure to be ready to immediately tackle new stuff. It is the best way to ensure that your team doesn't stuck by too many blockers.

## Conclusion
Honestly I think I am personally done trying to "win" at hackathons anymore; the idea of staying up all night coding on a foldable table doesn't excite me the way it did one year ago. However, they can be fun and worthwhile if you judge the prizes to be worth your time and effort. Oh, and I'll sneak in a secret technique as well.... I'm pretty sure nearly every single teammate I've had so far has some sort of hyperfixation problem. Me included.
